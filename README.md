Sarim Ahmad (Turing-26)

A passionate and versatile developer, based in Lahore.

I specialize in building performant and scalable web applications, predominantly working with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Python. Occasionally, I dive into C or C++, and I’m always eager to delve into low-level systems when the opportunity arises.
I thrive on turning creative ideas into impactful code—whether crafting seamless user experiences through modern web stacks or digging into the fundamentals of how things work at the system level.

I’m open to collaboration on projects that offer meaningful learning, growth, and innovation.
